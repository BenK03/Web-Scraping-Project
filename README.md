# Web-Scraping-Project
Developed a Python-based web scraper to systematically extract structured data from targeted websites by leveraging libraries like BeautifulSoup.
Utilized a hash set data structure to store unique records, ensuring constant time complexity for lookups and eliminating duplicates during the data storage process.
Implemented efficient data parsing techniques, converting HTML and JSON responses into useful data points for analysis and manipulation.
Incorporated exception handling and asynchronous requests to optimize scraping performance and enhance robustness for large-scale data extraction.
